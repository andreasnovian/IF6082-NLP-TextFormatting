i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday <NUM> december <NUM> ,COMMA and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period .PERIOD 
you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days ,COMMA during this part-session .PERIOD 
madam president ,COMMA on a point of order .PERIOD 
you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in sri lanka .PERIOD 
one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr kumar ponnambalam ,COMMA who had visited the european parliament just a few months ago .PERIOD 
would it be appropriate for you ,COMMA madam president ,COMMA to write a letter to the sri lankan president expressing parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in sri lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes ,COMMA mr evans ,COMMA i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .PERIOD 
if the house agrees ,COMMA i shall do as mr evans has suggested .PERIOD 
madam president ,COMMA on a point of order .PERIOD 
i would like your advice about rule <NUM> concerning inadmissibility .PERIOD 
my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again .PERIOD 
the cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before parliament on thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph <NUM> that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .PERIOD 
it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .PERIOD 
i believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible .PERIOD 
i want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report ,COMMA not a legislative proposal ,COMMA and whether that is something i can competently do on thursday .PERIOD 
that is precisely the time when you may ,COMMA if you wish ,COMMA raise this question ,COMMA i.e .PERIOD on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .PERIOD 
we shall call him mr hicks .PERIOD 
at the request of a french member ,COMMA mr zimeray ,COMMA a petition has already been presented ,COMMA which many people signed ,COMMA including myself .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA i would ask you ,COMMA in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the european parliament and by the whole of the european community ,COMMA to make representations ,COMMA using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent ,COMMA to the president and to the governor of texas ,COMMA mr bush ,COMMA who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person .PERIOD 
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld .PERIOD
